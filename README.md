# CSSE340-Web-Bundles-Research
A portfolio of our security research about Google's latest technology, Web Bundles, for the CSSE340 (Fundamentals of Cybersecurity) class.

**IMPORTANT - to students**: PLEASE DO NOT COPY THIS MATERIAL! You will hurt your own learning by doing so.

This repo is public because it's meant for employers to see my past experience and serves as a helpful reference of our research for anyone else interested in this topic.

It is also a creative project, unlike the ones in other courses where you make the same thing (such as a processor in CSSE232), so we feel it is OK to publish this as a reference.
